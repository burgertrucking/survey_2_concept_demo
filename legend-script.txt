[0s - 20s: Castle and the delta rune, panning down]

0s - 5s
A legend, old as the earth we abide,

5s - 10s
A tale, told under the stars that guide.

10s - 12s
A legend of dark,
(A tale of dreams,)

12s - 15s
A legend of light.
(A tale of hope.)

[The pan down focuses on the Delta Rune]
15s - 20s
The legend of Delta Rune tells our plight.


[20s - 24s: The human and darkner]

The parallel worlds of light and dark,
In harmony, so beat their hearts.


[25s - 29s: Shattered human and darkner]

But should this balance see interrupt,
Both domains alike will render corrupt.


[30s - 40s: The earth getting destroyed]

Chaos, and ruin, and roaring thunder
Crust of the earth now torn asunder.
Thunder and lightning strike from the sky,
As the land bellows her final cry.


[40s - 44s: The snowy desert field]

As nightmares haunt grimly,
And hope all but purged,


[45s - 49s: The heroes set foot on the snowy desert field]

Our guiding stars,
The saviors, emerge.


[Time this to each measure]
[50s - 51s: The human] (1/4)
A human,

[52s - 53s: The monster] (2/4)
A monster,

[53s - 56s: The monster] (3/4, 4/4)
A prince from the darkness.


[57s - 1m00s: All three heroes]

Three heroes of legend appear at world's edge.


[1m01s - 1m21s: Heroes sealing the fountain]

Geysers of black erupt from the earth,
Souls of the heroes shine power from within.
Freeing the world by sealing the fountains,
And banishing the Angel's false heaven.


[1m21s - 1m32s: Pan down on the castle, stop at the bottom for a bit]

This kingdom's Grand Fountain, piercing the sky,
Preserving the balance that keeps the worlds whole.


[1m32s - 1m42s (end): Pan to the right, showing the other fountain]

But off in the distance, another one rises,
And the balance grows ever annulled...
