A legend, old as the earth we abide,
A tale, told under the stars that guide.
A legend of dark,
(A tale of dreams,)
A legend of light.
(A tale of hope.)
The legend of Delta Rune tells our plight.

The parallel worlds of light and dark,
In harmony, so beat their hearts.
But should this balance see interrupt,
Both domains alike will render corrupt.

Chaos, and ruin, and roaring thunder
Crust of the earth now torn asunder.
Thunder and lightning strike from the sky,
As the land bellows her final cry.

As nightmares haunt grimly,
And hope all but purged,
Our guiding stars,
The saviors, emerge.

A human,
A monster,
A prince from the darkness.
Three heroes of legend appear at world's edge.

Geysers of black erupt from the earth,
Souls of the heroes shine power from within.
Freeing the world by sealing the fountains,
And banishing the Angel's false heaven.

This kingdom's Grand Fountain, piercing the sky,
Preserving the balance that keeps the worlds whole.
But off in the distance, another one rises,
And the balance grows ever annulled...
